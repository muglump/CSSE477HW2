# Installation Instructions
We choose to do this project as an iOS application, however due to restrictions of the iOS platform (primarily code signing) it is only able to be run in the simulator.

All build actions should be done from the Workspace. Individual project files will not build alone.

## 1. Build all Plugins
Change the active target to a given plugin ("Cats", "Img", or "Ponies") and build it. These are bundles so you can't run them, only build. These will be placed in the Workspace's build directory. You can find this by using Xcode's organizer view, or by looking around inâ€¦

	~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Workspace-<UUID>/Build/Products/*.bundle

## 2. Install the App
Change the active target to the CSSE477HW2 project, and run to install on the simulator.

## 3. Install Plugins
Install plugins by moving their .bundle from the build products directory to `~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/7.0/Applications/<UUID>/Library/Plugins`

Note: you should move the bundles, not copy them, as this can sometimes cause the bundles to be loaded before all their resources copy, causing them to fail to load.

# 4. Delete Plugins
Just delete them from the plugins directory.
